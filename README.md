In this notebook, we will leverage several datasets.

Datasets A
Covid 19 DataHub
Open-Access Data and Computational Resources to Address COVID-19 

The first datasets have collected / collated a large amount of information about COVID-19 cases in the United States.

ETL strategy: since the data is ready and available as CSV files, we will simply (a) download the CSV files directly, (b) modify / transform the dataset to fit our purposes, and (c) store the data in a SQL database

Visualization: We will use the dataset to re-create the graph showing the evolution of new cases in the US over time. 
Datasets B
US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Alcohol expenditures
Alcohol Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic

The second datasets have collected / collated a large amount of information about alcohol consumption cases in the United States during covid.

ETL strategy: since the data is ready and available as CSV files, we will simply (a) download the CSV files directly, (b) modify / transform the dataset to fit our purposes, and (c) store the data in a SQL database

Visualization: We will use the dataset to re-create the graph showing the evolution of new cases in the US over time.
